# maintainance-minio-cluster


*To expand storage capacity for 1 Minio cluster. I have some solutions as follows.*

| Solution | Description | Use cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Expand storage capacity with LVM | Extending a Logical Volume | Expand storage capacity |
| Add new pool & decommission a Server Pool | New pool must have enough capacity to store all data of the pool that needs to be cleaned up or replaced to expand storage capacity (recommend minimum x2 capacity current pool) | Expand storage capacity, replace/upgrade devices, disks, data storage location |
| Replace the new mount volume with one that has more free disk space | Take advantage of the HEALING feature | Expand storage capacity, replace/upgrade disk storage |
